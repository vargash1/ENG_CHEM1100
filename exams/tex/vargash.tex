    \textbf{1. There are two naturally occurring types of chlorine, $\ce{^{35}Cl}$ $(34.969 \si{\atomicmassunit})$ and $\ce{^{37}Cl}$ $(36.966 \si{\atomicmassunit})$}

    \textbf{a) Given that the atomic weight of chlorine is $36.45 \si{\atomicmassunit}$, what are the abundances of $\ce{^{35}Cl}$ and $\ce{^{37}Cl}$ ?}

    %You can combine the two to give you italicized bold text
    \textbf{\textit{Solution to a}}
    $$36.45 = 34.969x + 36.966(1 - x)$$
    $$\downarrow$$
    $$x = .759 = 75.9 \%$$

    Thus, $\ce{^{35}Cl}$ accounts for $75.9 \%$ of all chlorine. Whereas $\ce{^{37}Cl}$ accounts for $24.1 \%$ of all chlorine.\\[1cm]

    \textbf{b) What makes $\ce{^{35}Cl}$ different from $\ce{^{37}Cl}$?}

    \textbf{\textit{Solution to b}}

    Both of these isotopes of chlorine differ by the number of neutrons they both have. It's important to note that the number of protons must remain the same. A different number of protons results in a different element. The difference in neutrons is what contributes to the difference in weight.\\[1cm]

    \textbf{c)Which chlorine is regular chlorine and which one is the isotope?}

    \textbf{\textit{Solution to c}}

    The term regular would be a bit inaccurate. They are both regular chlorine, what makes them 'regular' is the fact that one of their isotopes is in higher abundance. Thus $\ce{^{35}Cl}$ is the so called regular chlorine since it is more abundant.

    \textbf{\textit{Solution to a}}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\ce{NH3}$ Weak Base.
        \item $\ce{HCl}$ Strong Acid.
        \item $\ce{KI}$ Neither an acid or base.
        \item $\ce{Ca(OH)2}$ Strong Base.
    \end{enumerate}

    \textbf{b) Predict the product of the following reaction. Make sure the reaction is balanced.}
    $$\ce{2H3PO4} + \ce{Ca(OH)2} \rightarrow \emptyset + \emptyset$$

    \textbf{\textit{Solution to b}}
    We know that acid base reactions must result in a salt and water. Thus we already know that one of the products is water. Thus the reaction below is what we have so far, all we need now is the salt and balancing. Lets start with the first reactant, balancing tends to rely on even factors.
    $$\ce{2H3PO4} + \ce{Ca(OH)2} \rightarrow \emptyset + \ce{H2O}$$
    Now he have a total of 6 hydrogens, not to mention the 2 hydrogens and 2 oxygens from the 2nd reactant. Thus we know that we have $\ce{8H}$ and $\ce{2O}$. Since one of our products is water, every 2 hydrogen's must have an oxygen.
    $$\ce{2H3PO4} + \ce{3Ca(OH)2} \rightarrow \emptyset + \ce{H2O}$$
    Now we have a total of $\ce{12H}$ and $\ce{6O}$. For each 2 Hydrogens, we have an Oxygen. This gives us.
    $$\ce{2H3PO4} + \ce{3Ca(OH)2} \rightarrow \emptyset + \ce{6H2O}$$
    Now we can much more easily determine the salt.
    $$\ce{2H3PO4}(aq) + \ce{3Ca(OH)2}(aq) \rightarrow \ce{Ca3(PO4)2}(s) + \ce{6H2O}(l)$$

    \textbf{c) Write a net ionic equation for b).}

    \textbf{\textit{Solution to c}}
    $$\ce{6H^{+}} (aq) + \ce{2PO4^{3-}} (aq) + \ce{3Ca^{2+}} (aq) + \ce{6OH^{-}} (aq) \rightarrow \ce{Ca3(PO4)2}(s) + \ce{6H2O}(l)$$

    \textbf{d) Identify the acid and the base in the following reaction(remember the Bronsted Lowry definition)}
    $$\ce{CH_{3}COOH} + \ce{NH_{3}} \rightarrow \ce{CH_{3}COO^{-}} + \ce{NH_{4}^{+}}$$

    \textbf{\textit{Solution to d}}
    According the Bronsted Lowry definition, acids are proton($\ce{H+}$) donators, whereas bases are proton($\ce{H+}$) acceptors. Thus using this definition, we can see that in the above equation that $\ce{CH_{3}COOH}$ was the acid as it lost its hydrogen. This means that $\ce{NH_{3}}$ must be the base.

        \item Indicate what element is being oxidized and what is being reduced
        \item Indicate how many electrons were transferred in the reaction\\[1cm]
    \end{enumerate}

    a) $ \ce{2 C_{2}H_{2}} + \ce{3 O_{2}} \rightarrow \ce{2CO_{2}} + \ce{2 H_{2}O}$

    \textbf{\textit{Solution to a}}
    $$ \ce{2 C_{2}^{-1}H_{2}^{1+}} + \ce{3 O_{2}^{0}} \rightarrow \ce{2C^{4+}O_{2}^{-2}} + \ce{2 H_{2}^{1+}O^{-2}} $$
    Oxygen is being oxidized whereas carbon is being reduced. The amount of electrons transferred in this reaction is
    10. Oxygen has a charge of 0 on the reactant side, but moves on  to have a two -2 charges on the product side. Whereas Carbon loses a total of 6 electrons in order to match the new charge of oxygen on the product side.\\[1cm]

    b) $\ce{Cu^{2+}} + \ce{Zn} \rightarrow  \ce{Zn^{2+}} + \ce{Cu}$

    \textbf{\textit{Solution to b}}
    $$ \ce{Cu^{2+}} + \ce{Zn^{0}} \rightarrow  \ce{Zn^{2+}} + \ce{Cu^{0}} $$
    Copper is being reduced whereas Zinc is being oxidized. The total transfer of electrons is 4. 2 for oxidizing copper from a charge of $+2$ to $0$, and then 2 for reducing zinc from $0$ to $+2$.\\[1cm]

    c) $\ce{P_{4}} + \ce{10 HClO} + \ce{6 H_{2}O} \rightarrow \ce{4 H_{3}PO_{4}} + \ce{10 HCl}$

    \textbf{\textit{Solution to c}}
    $$\ce{P_{4}^{0}} + \ce{10 H^{+1}Cl^{+1}O^{-2}} + \ce{6 H_{2}^{+1}O^{-2}} \rightarrow \ce{4 H_{3}^{+1}PO_{4}^{-3}} + \ce{10 H^{+1}Cl^{-1}}$$
     Phosphorus becomes part of a new compound that has a charge of $-3$, thus it becomes oxidized. Chlorine initially has a charge of $+1$ on the reactant side when it is part of $\ce{HClO}$, however it then becomes reduced in $\ce{HCl}$ by 2 electrons. Thus, the total amount of transferred electrons is 6 electrons.

    Describe in detail, with specifics, how you could use the chemicals available to identify the three metal samples. Feel free to make use of the galvanic series below.

    \textbf{\textit{Solution}}

    $\ce{Zn(NO3)2}$ will react with manganese only, you can use this information to identify the manganese sample. $\ce{Ni(NO3)2}$ will react with cobalt and manganese, but since you have identified manganese already, then the solution will react with cobalt only. Thus you have identified 2 of 3 metals. $\ce{HCl}$ will react with all metals except silver, but by process of elimination, you already know silver is the metal that hasn't been identified yet.

    \textbf{\textit{Solution to b}}
    $$\text{Moles of \ce{Au}} = \dfrac{.0178 \si{\gram}}{197 \si[per-mode=symbol]{\gram\per\mol}} = 9.035 * 10^{-5} \si{\mole}$$

    \textbf{A) Describe the phenomenon due to which the region of the atmosphere we call the sky is blue at noon on a sunny day. (aka Why is the sky blue?)}

    \textbf{Solution}

    Blue light is the type of light most scattered by air. At dawn and dusk, the angle of the light from the sun causes more red to be scattered near the sun. Which is why we see reddish sunsets and sunrises.\\[1cm]

    \textbf{B) We have talked about two ways to categorize compounds so far, molecules, and ionic compounds. How are these two types of compounds different from each other? How does difference influence the way they behave in solution?}

    \textbf{Solution}

    These two different types of compounds primarily differ in the method in which they bond. Ionic compounds transfer electrons, whereas molecules share electrons. Ionic compounds will require transfer of electrons to react in a solution, whereas compounds will require you to break their bonds.

    \end{enumerate}
    \textbf{Answer}\\

    1. $\ce{LiF}$ has a greater lattice energy due to the size difference. The increased atomic radii of $\ce{Cs}$ and $\ce{I}$ results in less lattice energy. Lithium and Fluorine are smaller relative to Cesium and Iodine, resulting in a tighter pull from the nucleus to the electrons. Thus, $\ce{LiF}_{\text{Lattice Energy}} > \ce{CsI}_{\text{Lattice Energy}}$

    2. In contrary to the previous question. The charge of each element has more influence on the lattice energy. $\ce{Mg^{2+}}$ and $\ce{O^{2-}}$ have a greater net charge difference than $\ce{Li^{+}}$ and $\ce{F^{-}}$

    \textbf{a)  The Balmer series is the series of emissions arising from the fall of an electron from a higher orbital to the $n = 2$ orbital. Calculate the wavelength of the lowest energy transition in the Balmer series.}\\
    \textbf{\textit{Solution}}
    $$\dfrac{1}{\lambda} = R_{H}(\dfrac{1}{n^{2}_{f}} - \dfrac{1}{n^{2}_{i}}) \rightarrow \dfrac{1}{\lambda} = R_{H}(\dfrac{1}{2^{2}} - \dfrac{1}{3^{2}})$$
    $$\downarrow$$
    $$\dfrac{1}{\lambda} = 1523611.11^{-1} \rightarrow \lambda = 656 \si{\nano\metre}$$
    It's important to note that this wavelength is well within our viewing range!

    \textbf{b) The Lyman series is a set of emissions arising from the fall of an electron from a higher orbital to the $n = 1$ orbital. Do you expect emissions in this series to be higher in energy or lower than the Balmer series? Explain.}\\
    \textbf{\textit{Solution}}
    $$\dfrac{1}{\lambda} = R_{H}(\dfrac{1}{1^{2}} - \dfrac{1}{2^{2}}) \rightarrow 1.215 * 10^{-7} = 121 \si{\nano\meter}$$
    $$E = \dfrac{hc}{\lambda} $$
    $$ \downarrow $$
    $$E_{656 \si{\nano\meter}} = \dfrac{hc}{6.56 * 10^{-7}}  = 3.030 * 10^{-19} \si{\joule}$$
    $$E_{121 \si{\nano\meter}} = \dfrac{hc}{1.215 * 10^{-7}} = 1.636 * 10^{-18} \si{\joule}$$

    Shorter wavelengths have higher energy. Which is why gamma rays are dangerous, but transitions from higher orbital to lowest increase in energy. Such as $n=5$ to $n=2$. Thus, these emissions would be higher. The real contributor to more energy is higher $n$ orbital drop.

    \textbf{a) Ethane $(\ce{C2H6})$ and formaldehyde ($\ce{CH2O}$) have the same molar mass and similar size. Formaldehyde, however, boils at $-19\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$, and ethane boils at $-89\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. Explain this difference in terms of intermolecular forces.}

    The difference in boiling point suggests that formaldehyde has a particular type of intermolecular force that ethane does not have. Ethane's lewis structure is simply 2 carbons surrounded by hydrogen. Thus, it has no dipole-dipole interaction. We know that all compounds have London dispersion forces, thus it leaves us with Formaldehyde either having dipole-dipole attractions or h-bonds. However, formaldehyde cannot have h-bonds as it does not meet the criteria for doing so. Thus we know that formaldehyde has dipole-dipole intermolecular forces while ethane does not.  We can confirm this with the usage of Lewis structures. As you can see, the oxygen's charge is the primary reason for the dipole-dipole charge.

    \textbf{b) Methane $(\ce{CH4})$ and water ($\ce{H2O}$) have the same molar mass and similar size. None the less, methane boils at $-161\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  whereas water boils at $100\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. Explain this  dramatic difference in terms of intermolecular forces.}

    Unlike Methane, water has a hydrogen bond. These types of bonds are much stronger than London dispersion forces and dipole-dipole forces. Methane only has London dispersion forces, similar to Ethane in the previous example. This would explain why $\ce{HF}$ is known for having such a strong bond.
